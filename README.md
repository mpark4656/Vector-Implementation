# Vector-Implementation
Practice implementing Vector ADT C++.
Not the actual implementation of STL but supports similar operations.

Textbook example - Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ by Mark A. Weiss


**********UPDATE 10/7/2016**********
- Added support for brace-enclosed initialization list

- Vector can now be constructed in the following fashion

my::Vector<Object> container = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 };
